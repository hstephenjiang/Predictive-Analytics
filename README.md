# Predictive-Analytics
## Projec Overview
Construct probability models of customer activity, and estimate model parameters using the method of maximum likelihood; Choose among model specifications, using quantitative and qualitative criteria; Apply Bayesian methods for inference, classification and forecasting; Model integrated customer purchase and retention processes, use those models to estimate expected customer lifetime value.
### 1. Use Beta-Geometric (BG) model to forecast customer churn
### 2. Calculate Expected residual lifetime value (ERLV)/ Discounted Expected Residual Lifetime (DERL) and DERL/ERLV. Apply Bayesian update.
### 3. Beta-Geometric/Beta-Binomial (BGBB) Model
### 4. Negative Binomial Distribution (NBD) Model
